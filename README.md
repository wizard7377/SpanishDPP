# SpanishDPP
The Spanish version of the D++ docs.
The style of the docs matches with D++, including plenty of files taken verbatim from D++, including all files in the `config` folder (`style.css` and `footer.html` provide the look of D++ docs on top of [Doxygen Awesome CSS](https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css.git)). These docs are, however, **NOT** verbatim copies of the D++ docs in Spanish, but rather a set of docs that (for the most part) follows the structure of the D++ docs.

The actual website (run by github pages released whenever main is pushed to) is located at: https://wizard7377.github.io/SpanishDPP/
The D++ website is located at: https://dpp.dev/
The D++ github is located at: https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP.git
The D++ discord server (as of writing there are no Spanish help channels) can be found at: https://discord.gg/dpp

Any inquiries or issues about the project should be reported in Github issues and I can be messaged at the aforementioned Discord server.
